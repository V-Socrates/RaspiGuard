# RASPIGUARD Board For Home Monitoring Build Instrutions

### Background Knowledge
RaspiGuard is a home security/surveillance system that is used to monitor a room remotely using our android application. The current operational functionality is door and moisture sensors. We are currently working on the functionality of light sensors as well as various other sensors. Installing a home security system can be costly, but needing one and not having one can cost you more. Fortunately, you will not have that dilemma with RaspiGuard. RaspiGuard is a cost-effective and easy to install security system that you can easily setup and deploy on your own.

### Implementing Everything Together / Testing.

1.	Build the above circuit using the GPIO pinout found on the PiTFT. The picture above shows a Raspberry Pi Model B which the pinout mirrors. It is recommended to use a ribbon cable to connect the above circuit for testing and easy modifications.
2.	Place the PiTFT on to the your Raspberry Pi 3 B.
3.	Download the Jesse Pitft image from adafruit (https://s3.amazonaws.com/adafruit-raspberry-pi/2016-11-08-pitft-35r.zip) and flash the image onto you microSD card. Minimum 8GB.
4.	Insert your SD card into your Raspberry Pi 3 B and power on your Pi.
5.	After powering on connect to the internet via Ethernet cable or Wifi.
6.	Execute the commands below into a terminal window. Default sudo password is raspberry.
* cd ~
* sudo apt-get update
* sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-smbus git
* cd ~
* git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_ADS1x15.git
* cd Adafruit_Python_ADS1x15
* sudo python setup.py install
* sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev python-smbus python-pip
* sudo pip install adafruit-ads1x15
* cd ~/Adafruit_Python_ADS1x15/examples
*wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/V-Socrates/RaspiGuard/master/Hardware/RG.py
7.	Execute the RG.py python script using “sudo python RG.py” to start your RaspiGuard unit.
